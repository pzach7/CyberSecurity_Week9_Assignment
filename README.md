Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild.

## Overview

In this assignment, you will stand up a basic honeypot and demonstrate its effectiveness at detecting and/or collecting data about an attack. Guided instructions for doing this using specific software are provided below, but you are free to take any approach you wish that demonstrates the following basic principles:

Successful configuration and deployment of a network-accessible honeypot server with two primary features:
